##  Motivations
This is a tiny project to start using c++ and graphic libraries. I have some back experience using WebGL and OpenGL but never used SDL2.

Fluids Simulation is one subject that looks fancy on a portfolio and I didn't want to be left behind!

## References
Thanks to the work of "[Fluid Simulation for Dummies (3D)](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)" by Mike Ash and the "Coding Challenge #132: Fluid Simulation" of the Youtube Channel "The Coding Train" I have been capable of learning a lot of copying and studying the code that they provide.

## Concepts
Some of the main subjects learned have been the Navier-Stokes equations that with some pain and dedication are quite interesting but overwhelming without a correct background. Concepts like Divergence and curl are nice to take a look too, 3Blue1Brown has a really sweet video about it, [check it out](https://youtu.be/rB83DpBJQsE) .


## Future Plans
One of my main objectives was to be capable of drawing the direction of the particles with colours or arrows but probably be wiser to use some more reliable libraries such as Lily Pad c++ implementations, nothing that could not be done in the nearly future.
