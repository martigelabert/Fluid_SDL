# FluId_SDL

##  Motivations
This is a tiny project to start using c++ and graphic libraries. I have some back experience using WebGL and OpenGL but never used SDL2.

Fluids Simulation are one subject that look really fancy on a portafolio and I didn't want to be left behind!

## References
Thanks to the work of "[Fluid Simulation for Dummies (3D)](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)" by Mike Ash and the "Coding Challenge #132: Fluid Simulation" of the Youtube Channel "The Coding Train" I have been capable of learning a lot copying and studying the code  that they provide.

## Concepts
Some of the main subjects learned have been the Navier-Stokes equations that with some pain and dedications are quait interesting but overwelming withouth a correct background. Concepts like Divergence and curl are nice to take a look too, 3Blue1Brown has a really sweet video about it, [check it out](https://youtu.be/rB83DpBJQsE) .


## Future Plans
Actually one of my main objectives was been capable of drawing the direction of the particles with colors or arrows, but probably is more wise to use some more realiable libraries as Lily Pad c++ implementations, nothing that could not be done in a nearly future.
